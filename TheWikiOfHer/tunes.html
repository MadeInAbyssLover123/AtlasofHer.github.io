<h2>What are Tunes?</h2>

<p>Tunes are the abilities of the game, and they are all obtainable with all Schools except for the Silent School. Tunes are obtained through crafting them, which requires ingredients, or getting them from mentors/trainers. There are two Tune types; Choreo and Charms.</p>

<p>Tunes are seen as tiny bells hanging by the player’s waist, up to 7 can be equipped. It is recommended to place the current weapon into the 8th slot to have better access to the 7 Tunes equipped (or to the last slot/to the right slot of the last Tune). Schools affect how Tunes work and how they look, but Weaver school is on a different spectrum and will be reworked.</p>

<h2>Choreos</h2>

<p>Choreos are physical Tunes that don't require magic, but some do. Choreos are obtained by stats that are in the body section, but sometimes require SOME levels in a stat from the mind section.</p>

<p>Choreos are usually close range, but some can be ranged based on context or usage.</p>

<p>Choreos can clash if both players use one at the same time.
Choreos do not need mana, but some may.</p>

<h2>Charms</h2>

<p>Charms are magical Tunes that require mana to be used. Charms are obtained from crafting. All Charms are tied to an affinity or two as they are all a part of the “Shinestar.”</p>

<p>Charms are basically spells. Some can create explosions, some can conjure spikes, some can heal wounds, and some can build walls. Not only that, a Charm can be modified to be upgraded, or to be something else entirely.</p>

<a href="template.html"><p>See this page for all current Charms and their upgrades.</p></a>

<h2>Choreos clashing</h2>

<p>When two players clash Choreos, a clashing sequence begins, and the players must wait until a victor has been chosen (winning the full clash). At the top of their heads, their clashing power is shown, which is based on the Choreo they have used. Clashing power is how much one clash can get, basically the minimum and maximum numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, RNG exists. Clashing power can vary from (1~10) or (3~12) or even (5~20). A player must win 5 clashes to win the full clash, which they will then execute the full Choreo they have originally used. This can go up to 9 clashes if lucky enough. The only way to have a guaranteed win is by having less posture than the opposing player</p>

<h2>Aquiring Choreos</h2>

<p>Choreos can be obtained from mentors or trainers.</p>
    
<p>Choreos are tied to specific Choreography Styles, and the player can equip up to 3 to become versatile. The quest for the Choreography Style must first be done before the player could get the Choreos of that style. The player can choose to unequip a Choreography if they want a new one.</p>

<h2>Aquiring Charms</h2>

<p>Normal ingredients used on gears can be used as well, but there must be at least one Tune Ingredient. Instead of following a recipe, the ingredients must have specific keywords to meet the requirements of a Tune. Adjacency is key.</p>

<p>Once the ingredients are acquired, the player must go through their menu wheel and go to Tunes. There, go to the crafting tab, and enter the ingredients. The player will then be in an animation where they place all ingredients on the floor and slam their right palm into the ground, dissolving the ingredients, and absorbing them into their right arm. The player will then receive 3 Tune Cards, and they must choose only one.</p>
